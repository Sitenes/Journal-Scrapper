Making smart decisions about what is needed to be studied is always a fundamental factor for researchers and can be challenging for them. The goal of this study is to identify hot topics and thematic trend analysis of articles indexed in Scopus database in the field of Knowledge and Information Science (KIS), between 2010 and 2019, using Text Mining techniques. The population consists of 50995 articles published in 249 journals indexed in Scopus database in the field of KIS from 2010 to 2019. To identify thematic clusters, algorithms of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique were used and the data were analyzed using libraries in Python software. To do this, by implementing the word weighting algorithm, using the TF-IDF method, and weighting all of the words and forming a text matrix, the topics in the documents and the coefficients for assigning each document to each topic (theta) were determined. The output of the LDA algorithm led to the identification of the optimal number of 260 topics. Each topic was labeled based on the words with the highest weight assigned to each topic and with considering of experts’ opinions. Then, Topic clustering, keywords and topics identification were done. By performing calculations with 95% confidence, 63 topics were selected from 260 main topics. By calculating the average theta in years, 24 topics with a positive trend or slope (hot topic) and 39 topics with a negative trend or negative slope (cold topic) were determined. According to the results, measurement studies, e-management/ e-marketing, content retrieval, data analysis and e-skills, are considered as hot topics and training, archive, knowledge management, organization and librarians’ health, were identified as cold topics in the field of KIS, in the period 2010 to 2019. The analysis of the findings shows that due to the interest of the most researchers in the last 10 years in using of emerging technologies, technology-based topics have attracted them more. In contrast, basic issues are less considered to be developed. © 2022 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

Identification and weighting of scientific outputs through the three steps of the library method, conducting interviews, and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); 2. Identifying the evaluation criteria of scientific outputs with the library method; and 3. determining priorities for evaluating scientific outputs through concurrent function deployment (CFD). Based on the findings, scientific outputs were divided into two categories: 1. Formats: scientific journal article, conference article, book, research project, and dissertation/thesis; 2. Activity: in policy-making, social (scientific-promotional), social (media), and economic contexts. Evaluation criteria are also divided into 8 categories: platform for creation, presentation and publication; writing structure; content; impact in online environment; scientific impact; social impact; economic impact; and cultural impact, each of which includes indicators. Finally, outputs and criteria have been prioritized according to three approaches and goals: production of science and promotion of knowledge foundations, applicability and responsiveness to society’s problems, literary creation/creative literature. Considering the importance and necessity of different evaluation of each field and discipline according to the nature of each one as an effective factor on the application and effectiveness of their scientific outputs, research policy makers can use a new approach in decision-making and establishing policies for evaluating the scientific outputs of the language and literature fields and humanities according to the results. © 2023 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

Then, NPL references listed in “Other References” section of the patents was extracted and abstract of the NPL references was retrieved from Scopus database. R software, topic modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm were used to analyze the data. Results showed that most of the subclasses in Nanotechnology use few NPL references and are more dependent on patents. In total, NPL references account for only 36% of patent citations. The topics of the NPL references in this field (nanotechnology) belonged to six categories: Physics, Electricity, Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Medicine, and Nanotechnology. Consequently, it seems that nanotechnology patents are more technology-driven, and a medium to low relationship exists between science and nanotechnology. The topic modeling of NPL references uncovered that nanotechnology patents have been more influenced by non-nano scientific. © 2022 The Author(s).

Given that the contribution of motor vehicles to air pollution is significant, both goals are achieved by managing urban transport. Among the various methods of travel demand management, congestion pricing is a very efficient measure. This study tried to simultaneously increase the efficiency of the transportation network and reduce the environmental effects by using a bi-level model for the multi-modal network. For this purpose, the upper-level model minimizes the objective function, i.e., pollution emission costs and overall commuting costs. The lower level also has a transportation network model that provides the condition of user equilibrium. The genetic and Frank-Wolfe algorithms have been used to solve the bi-level programming model. Two pricing schemes, cordon-based and link-based, are used to investigate and assist policymakers. The proposed algorithm is also applied to a real-world road network in Isfahan, Iran. The results of the proposed models for different pricing strategies were compared. According to the results, both pricing schemes mitigate traffic congestion and pollution, although the reduction in pollution outside the cordon is less than inside. Demand has also shifted from the private car mode to public transportation by an average of 15%. However, link-based pricing provides better performance than cordon-based pricing. This study indicated that a higher total collected toll in link-based pricing is accompanied by a sharper reduction in congestion and pollution mitigation, which can be spent on alternative facilities and infrastructure by the municipality, such as the development of public transportation and parking. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",Air pollution; Cordon-based pricing; Genetic algorithm; Isfahan; Link-based pricing; Urban transportation;,,,16,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isfahan is the third most populated city in Iran, and its pollution is a leading cause of many diseases and deaths, and economic problems every year. Root cause analysis of air pollution can help the government and legislators make laws for reducing air pollution. As critical factors play an important role in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emission, traffic parameters should be essential in air pollution modeling. Methods: The generalized additive model (GAM), as a flexible statistical model, is implemented to demonstrate non-linear and linear relationships between response and predictive variables by nonparametric smooth functions. Traffic counts and meteorological and spatial variables were considered independent variables in this research. Regarding evaluating the health outcomes of air pollution due to traffic, the AirQ+ model is implemented. Results: This research was applied for Isfahan in the two years from 2018 to 2020 based on experimental data. The results indicated that the models could explain 54%–69% of PM2.5 concentrations in different areas. In Isfahan's southern and central regions, the effect of traffic on PM2.5 pollution was more. Low values of temperature also affected concentration pollution. Moreover, the model was estimated seasonally for further investigation. Also, annual premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 due to traffic is 150 and 157 cases over two years. Conclusions: The results show the health impacts of air pollution due to vehicular PM2.5 emissions are remarkable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; AirQ; Fine particulate matter; Generalized additive model; Health effects; Vehicular traffic;,,,39,,Journal of Transport and Health,21100310028,24,3/22/2025,1/27/2025 14:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, we calculate the economic costs of air pollution emitted by vehicles in Isfahan over the period from March 2018 to March 2020. The concentration of urban traffic pollution based on the generalized additive model (GAM) as well as spatial distribution of pollution is estimated. Health effects are evaluated using AirQ+ updated by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health. Economic burden of mortality attributable air pollution from traffic is calculated using value of a statistical life (VOSL), and the value of life years (VOLY) approach. The results indicated that the number of deaths attributable to PM2.5 from motor vehicles in these two consecutive years was 136 (95%CI: 89–179), and 147 cases (95%CI: 96–194), respectively. The number of years of life lost due to premature death from air pollution was 2079 years annually. The economic costs imposed under VOSL approach were on average USD 51.7 (95%CI: 43–75) million per year, and according to VOLY approach USD 11.5 (95%CI: 9–13) million per year. These results help to analyze the cost-benefit and prioritize control measures to reduce air pollution. In addition, combination of these results with other externality cost of road traffic can take account for urban transportation planning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",AirQ; Economic valuation; Fine particulate matter; Generalized additive model; Urban transportation; Value of a statistical life;,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecules that can inhibit or reverse the aggregation process of amyloidogenic proteins have potential therapeutic value. The anti-aggregating activity of multiple carotenoid compounds has been reported over the past decades against a growing list of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Here, we aimed to determine whether crocin, the main carotenoid glycoside component of saffron, would inhibit hαS aggregation or could disassemble its preformed fibrils. By employing a series of biochemical and biophysical techniques, crocin was exhibited to inhibit hαS fibrillation in a dose-dependent fashion by stabilizing very early aggregation intermediates in off-pathway non-toxic conformations with little β-sheet content. We also observed that crocin at high concentrations could efficiently destabilize mature fibrils and disassemble them into seeding-incompetent intermediates by altering their β-sheet conformation and reshaping their structure. Our atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that crocin molecules bind to both the non amyloid-β component (NAC) region and C-terminal domain of hαS. These interactions could thereby stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of the protein and prevent it from adopting aggregation-prone structures. MD simulations further suggested that ligand molecules prefer to reside longitudinally along the fibril axis onto the edges of the inter-protofilament interface where they establish hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with steric zipper stabilizing residues. These interactions turned out to destabilize hαS fibrils by altering the interstrand twist angles, increasing the rigidity of the fibril core, and elevating its radius of gyration. Our findings suggest the potential pharmaceutical implication of crocin in synucleinopathies. ©",aggregation; crocin; fibril; Parkinson's disease; saffron; synuclein;,,,25,1,ACS Chemical Neuroscience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA for hAS was inserted into plasmid pET32a and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with an N-terminal tag containing E. coli thioredoxin (trx), followed by a histidine hexapeptide, and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (trx-6His-TEV). The fusion protein, trx-hAS, was initially released by osmotic shock treatment from the host cells and subsequently purified using a nickel affinity chromatography. A TEV protease cleavage step was performed to liberate the target protein, hAS, from the fusion partner, trx. Finally, an additional nickel affinity chromatography was performed to further purify the digested product. The yield of this method is ∼25 mg of tag-less protein (with ∼99% purity) per liter of culture volume. Reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry confirmed the purity and authenticity of the purified protein. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrated that the purified proteins form fibrils.

In the current investigation, the association of USF1s2 variant of human USF1 gene with premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) was evaluated in a population from southern Iran. USF1s2 has the best potential as a functional variant.in the USF1 gene. Methods: In a case-control study USF1s2 variant of human USF1 gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique using BsiHKA I restriction enzyme for 186 women under 55 years of age and 135 men less than 50 years of age who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography in Saadi, Nemazee and Kowsar Hospitals of Shiraz, between July 2009 and March 2012. Data on the history of familial myocardial infarction or other heart diseases, hypertension, and smoking habit were collected by a simple questionnaire. Blood sugar level and serum lipid profile of all participants were also obtained by measuring the levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Results: Frequencies of the major (G) and minor (A) alleles of usf1s2 gene variant were 0.74 and 0.26 in the whole population, respectively. Meanwhile, the prevalence of the minor allele was significantly higher in PCAD patients compared with control subjects. This difference remained significant even after adjustment for confounding parameters. Indeed, subjects with mutant homozygous genotype (AA) were about 5 times more likely to suffer from early-onset CAD than those with wild-type homozygous genotype (GG). Moreover, the baseline characteristics of the control subjects and patients were statistically similar for almost all parameters except for the number of male individuals; there was no significant difference among various genotypes in the patient group for any of these investigated variables. Conclusion: It appears that the usf1s2 variant in upstream transcription factor 1 gene is an independent predictor of premature coronary artery disease in our population and applies its effects without affecting blood sugar and lipid levels. © 2015, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

This paper uses rough set theory (RST) in order to reduce the number of dimensions in a CBR classifier with the aim of increasing accuracy and efficiency. CBR exploits a distance based co-occurrence of categorical data to measure similarity of cases. This distance is based on the proportional distribution of different categorical values of features. The weight used for a feature is the average of co-occurrence values of the features. The combination of RST and CBR has been applied to real categorical datasets of Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Lymphography, and Primary cancer. The 5-fold cross validation method is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that this combined approach lowers computational costs and improves performance metrics including accuracy and interpretability compared to other approaches developed in the literature. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd.

However the relationship between this mutation and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has remained as a controversial issue. The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene, plasma total Hcy levels and the number of affected vessels as a criterion for the extent of CAD. MTHFR genotypes and plasma homocysteine (HCY) concentrations were examined in 231 patients and 300 healthy subjects who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of Hcy levels whereas logistic regression model was built to determine the association of Hcy quartiles with the risk of CAD adjusted for risk factors. The prevalence of MTHFR genotypes was similar between CAD patients and non-CAD individuals while the geometric mean of Hcy values was significantly higher in patient group (14.13 ± 4.11 μmol/l) than in control group (10.19 ± 3.52 μmol/l) (P < 0.001). Moreover, unlike the MTHFR polymorphism, Hcy concentration increased with increasing number of stenosed vessels and the CAD risk increased about 2 folds in the top two Hcy quartiles (≥ 17.03 and 13.20-17.02 μmol/l) compared with the lowest quartile (≤ 9.92 μmol/l) after controlling for conventional risk factors (P<0.001 for both).

Two cases in which the squeezed vacuum is generated by degenerate and nondegenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We find that for the case of finite-bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection, the two spectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband squeezing excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a four-peaked structure, respectively, for the squeezing injection from DPO and NDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as squeezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be highly sensitive to the squeezing parameters and the temperature of the mirror. We also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum quadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the squeezing parameters of the input field on the mechanical squeezing. It will be shown that the parameters of driven squeezed vacuum affects the squeezing.

The effects of temperature and initial excited state on the energy transfer and the quantum correlation are studied. It is shown, in agreement with the previous results, that the increasing of the temperature gives rise to the faster delocalisation of energy transfer and global quantum entanglement in the FMO complex. The proposed model predicts that the global discord is resistance versus the raising temperature. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the quantum entanglement with respect to the global quantum discord has a significant role in the process of energy transfer in the FMO complex. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",Energy transfer; FMO complex; quantum correlation;,,,12,,Molecular Physics,26990,114,7/17/2016,1/26/2025 18:39,,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the proposal can be extended to the multi-cavity case, where the cavities are arranged such that their time evolutions change alternately from JC to anti-JC Hamiltonian. From this configuration, three- and four-partite GHZ states can be generated. At last, it is illustrated that in the multi-cavity set up if one prepares all cavities with the same time evolution property, W state can be produced.

Due to the heavy and costly damage that the surge may cause in various industrial processes such as petrochemical plants, it is necessary to design an appropriate control system to reduce the effect of this phenomenon. The problem of active surge control of a centrifugal compressor using the throttle control valve (TCV) in the presence of compressor parametric uncertainties as well as large demands on upstream and downstream loads is investigated in this work. The control objective was to design a robust control system that can stabilize the compressor over a wide operating range without knowing the upper bound for the uncertainties and load demand. The controller should also react quickly by generating a smooth control signal without saturating the control input. These objectives are achieved by designing a sliding mode controller along with a nonlinear disturbance observer. The performance of the proposed disturbance observer-based controller is evaluated under various operational and load conditions and the results are compared against fuzzy type 1, conventional sliding mode, and wavelet-based neural network robust adaptive controllers. The results show that the proposed method can tolerate large disturbances without any knowledge on the upper bound of the incident disturbance, both on the downstream pressure and upstream mass flow which is highly desirable in practice. The comparative study proves the efficacy of the proposed method using various performance measures. The study also confirms the superior robust performance and stability of the proposed method in front of matched and mismatched disturbances as well as model uncertainties especially close to the instability boundary. Although choosing a TCV actuator has made the control system design easier, the sensitivity of the control valve to flow coefficient and zero calibration under different operating ranges of the compression system is studied carefully and some recommendations for the users are provided. © 2024 The Authors",Centrifugal compressor; Nonlinear disturbance observer; Sliding mode control; Surge; Throttle control valve;,,,1,,Journal of Process Control,14414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This computation is accomplished by minimizing a υ-gap metric criterion. For this purpose, the problem is formulated to a convex optimization context, such that a semidefinite programming (SDP) can be implemented. Minimization constraints and the normality constraints of coprime factors are converted to linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Thus, by convex optimization algorithms, the semidefinite programming will be optimized. The proposed method can also be used for non-square multi input multi output systems in a conservative assumption. So, through the first process of optimization, the frequency responses of the normalized coprime factors are derived. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in the computation of the normalized coprime factors of a system, the simulated results of this method are compared with those obtained by the other methods for two types of systems. © 2021 The Authors.

The people with similar heart conditions almost have similar electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. By analyzing the ECG signals' patterns one can predict arrhythmias. Since the conventional methods of arrhythmia detection rely on observing morphological features of the ECG signals which are tedious and very time consuming, the automatic detection of arrhythmia is more preferable. In order to automate detection of heart diseases an adequate algorithm is required which could classify the ECG signals with unknown features according to the similarities between them and the ECG signals with known features. If this classifier can find the similarities precisely, the probability of arrhythmia detection is increased and this algorithm can become a useful means in laboratories. In this article a new classification method is presented to classify ECG signals more precisely based on dynamical model of the ECG signal. In this proposed method a fuzzy classifier is constructed and its simulation results indicate that this classifier can segregate the ECGs with an accuracy of 93.34%. To further improve the performance of this classifier, genetic algorithm is applied where the accuracy in prediction is increased up to 98.67%.

A unique feature of an ESN is that a large number of neurons (the “reservoir”), whose synaptic connections are generated randomly, is used in such that only the connections from the reservoir to the output modified by learning. The computation of optimal weights can then be achieved by a simple linear regression in an offline manner. ESNs have been applied to a variety of tasks from time series prediction to dynamic pattern recognition with great success. In many tasks, however, an online adaptive learning of the output weights is required. Harmony Search (HS) algorithm shows good performance when the search space is large. Here we propose HS algorithm for training echo state network in an online manner. In our simulation experiments, the ESNs are trained for predicting of three different time series including Mackey-Glass, Lorenz chaotic and Rossler chaotic time series with four different algorithms including Recursive Least Squares (RLS-ESN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-ESN), and our proposed methods (HS-ESN and HS-RLS-ESN). Simulation results show that HS-ESN is significantly the fastest algorithm for training ESN whereas can effectively meet the requirements of the output precision. HS-RLS-ESN algorithm firstly uses HS to close to solution region then it uses RLS to obtain less error. HS-RLS-ESN is slower than HS-ESN and faster than RLS-ESN, but its generality power is very close to RLS-ESN. © 2017 [International Journal of Artificial Intelligence",Chaotic time series; Echo state network; Harmony search algorithm; Recursive least squares;,,,14,,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence,19600166036,15,Spring 2017,1/26/2025 21:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unknown system parameters are estimated by using an adaptive parameter identifier, whose gains are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Removing the trial and error procedure and ensuring the convergence property together with fast response, are the benefits of such identification scheme. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, hydrodynamic parameter variations and external disturbances which affect the identified dynamical model, are also taken into account. The cross-coupling effects between subsystems are also considered as model uncertainties. Such uncertain model is then adopted in control synthesis procedure, in the steering and diving modes. In order to achieve the robust stability and performance, two robust control strategies are presented here to solve the motion control problem. First, an H∞ mixed sensitivity problem is formulated in which the weighting functions are selected based on an optimization criterion, by using PSO algorithm. Controller order reduction is also applied to the resulting diving and steering controllers, using the Hankel norm approximation. Then, an Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC), whose sliding surface coefficients are optimized by PSO algorithm, is developed for the identified AUV model. Possessing the robustness properties with respect to system perturbations, the developed Sliding Mode Control (SMC) removes the complexity of uncertain model representation and the limitations on choosing the weighting functions in the H∞ control problem.

The governing aeroelastic equations are presented in the structure of fully intrinsic and these equations are discretized using the finite difference method. Results: The effects of the presence of an aerodynamic control surface have been investigated based on the analytical-experimental relationships and considering the nonlinear effects of high control surface deflections. Furthermore, investigation of the effects of some important parameters such as deflections, location, chord size, and length of the control surface on the speed and frequency of flutter instability, is another achievement of this article. Conclusions: The results show that based on aeroelastic considerations, the deflection angle of the control surface has an important effect on the aeroelastic stability.

The proposed method uses only the state measurements of an aircraft and does not require control commands, air data systems, or satellite-based data. Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can benefit from this method, since it relies solely on measurement results from the common sensors as an attitude and heading reference system. The independence of external sources of information made estimations resistant to intentional errors. This algorithm uses long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM NNs) in a two-step deep learning process involving classification and regression. A classification NN was trained with four different labeled wind models, while individual regression NNs were trained to estimate the velocity vector and parameters of each wind model. The linear acceleration, angular velocity, and Euler angle measurements were used as the inputs of trained networks. The algorithm suggests in its first step identifying the exact wind model, and in its second step estimating the wind velocity vector and parameters using a properly assigned estimation from a trained network. A nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulation of straightforward and level turn maneuvers of a fixed-wing UAV in the presence of different wind models served as the dataset in the learning process.

This is the first simulation that considers all temporal distortions jointly, along with static lens distortions in an online manner. Several innovations are proposed including a motion tracking system allowing the camera to follow the flight log with eligible derivatives. A reverse pipeline, relating each pixel in the output image to pixels in the ideal input image, is developed. It is shown that the inverse lens distortion model and the inverse temporal distortion models are decoupled in this way. A short-time pixel displacement model is proposed to solve for temporal distortions (i.e. delay, rolling shutter, motion blur, and interlacing). Evaluation is done by several means including regenerating an airborne dataset, regenerating the camera path on a calibration pattern, and evaluating the ability of the time displacement model to predict other frames.

The first layer is used as an ablative layer to control the temperature where the second and third layers are used as an insulator to control the heat fluxes. Proposed cooling method has been applied for two real bipropellant thrusters. According to the results, the presented algorithm can suitably predict the heat fluxes and satisfy the wall temperature constraint. Then, the algorithm has been used to minimize the wall temperatures as low as possible and replace high temperature materials (platinum alloy) with common materials (composite or steel). It is shown that selection of TPS materials affects the TPS mass and Isp simultaneously, but conversely. Best solution should be derived by trading off between structure temperature (cost), Isp (performance), and TPS thicknesses (geometry). Multidisciplinary approach to TPS and structure material selection of a bipropellant thruster is presented for a case study. It has been shown that mass and performance penalties of using TPS are acceptable, considering the advantages of using steel alloy instead of platinum alloy. © 2016, Indian Academy of Sciences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimization of such a complex system involved in optimization of many disciplines including structure, heat transfer, aerothermodynamics, guidance and control, trajectory and propulsion. Hard coupling of the disciplines increase the optimization processing times. Multidisciplinary design optimization algorithm can derive the optimum configuration but more elapsed time is needed for single-level methods such as all at once (AAO) and lower feasibility occurred in multi-level methods such as collaborative optimization (CO). In this paper, a new multidisciplinary design optimization framework is proposed for such coupled disciplines with concentrating on the propulsion system. The proposed framework uses Combined Single-level and Bi-level Optimizations (CSBO) frameworks to minimize numbers of design variables and system constraints when feasibility is increased. For this goal, modeling of every discipline is introduced and the design algorithm validated by redesigning of two real bipropellant thrusters. Three MDO frameworks are applied for our problem including AAO, CO and CSBO. Comparisons between the results show that CSBO can find the optimum solution in shorter elapsed time with lower F-count. Therefore, CSBO is more efficient for complex systems with coupled disciplines. © 2015 IAA",AAO; Bipropellant thruster; CO; Multidisciplinary design; Optimization; Upper-stage;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, mathematical modeling of a discipline can be improved for each module. The purpose of this paper is to show that multi-modular design optimization (MMO) improves the design performances in comparison with MDO technique for complex systems. Design/methodology/approach – MDO framework and MMO framework are developed to optimum design of a complex system. The nonlinear equality and inequality constrains are considered. The system optimizers included Genetic Algorithm and Sequential Quadratic Programming. Findings – As shown, fewer design variables (optimization variables) are needed at the system level for MMO. Unshared variables are optimized in the related module when shared variables are optimized at the system level. The results of this research show that MMO has lower elapsed times (14 percent) with lower F-count (16 percent). Practical implications – The monopropellant propulsion upper-stage is selected as a case study. In this paper, the efficient model of the monopropellant propulsion system is proposed. According to the results, the proposed model has acceptable accuracy in mass model (error <2 percent), performance estimation (error <6 percent) and geometry estimation (error <10 percent).

As the IoT has limited processing and computing power, we are turning to integration of cloud and IoT. Cloud computing processes large data at high speed, but sending this large data requires a lot of bandwidth. Therefore, we use fog computing, which is close to IoT devices. In this case, the delay is reduced. Both cloud and fog computing are used to increasing performance of IoT. Job scheduling of IoT workflow requests based on cloud-fog computing plays a key role in responding to these requests.

In this article, three-objective Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) scheduling algorithm is proposed in order to reduce makespan time, energy consumption and increase reliability. Also, dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) has been used to reduce energy consumption, which reduces frequency of the processor.

Currently, the low-latency ITS requirements are hard to achieve in the conventional cloud-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infrastructure. In the context of IoV, Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has become recognized as an inventive and viable architecture that can effectively decrease the time required for the computation of diverse vehicular application activities. Vehicles receive rapid task execution services from VFC. The benefits of fog computing and vehicular cloud computing are combined in a novel concept called fog-based Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). These networks depend on a movable power source, so they have specific limitations. Cost-effective routing and load distribution in VANETs provide additional difficulties. In this work, a novel method is developed in vehicular applications to solve the difficulty of allocating limited fog resources and minimizing the service latency by using parked vehicles. Here, the improved heuristic algorithm called Revised Fitness-based Binary Battle Royale Optimizer (RF-BinBRO) is proposed to solve the problems of vehicular networks effectively. Additionally, the combination of Deep Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (DARL) and the improved BinBRO algorithm effectively analyzes resource allocation, vehicle parking, and movement status. Here, the parameters are tuned using the RF-BinBRO to achieve better transportation performance. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out.

Multimedia vehicles connected to the Internet of Things are increasing; there are millions of vehicles and heavy multimedia traffic in the IoV network. The network's scarcity of resources results in overload, which, in turn, leads to a degradation of both Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). Conversely, when resources are abundant, it leads to unnecessary energy wastage. Managing IoV network resources optimally while considering constraints such as Energy, Load, QoS, and QoE is a complex challenge. To address this, the study proposes a solution by decomposing the problem and designing a modular architecture named $\textit {ELQ}^{\vphantom {D^{j}}2}$. This architecture enables simultaneous control of the mentioned constraints, effectively reducing overall complexity. To achieve this objective, Network Softwarization and Virtualization concepts are employed. This modern architecture allows dynamically adjusting of the scale of the resources on demand, effectively reducing energy usage. Additionally, this architecture provides some other potentials, such as 'the distribution of multimedia traffic among servers', 'determining the route with high QoS for traffic', and 'selecting a media with high QoE'. A real test field is provided by Floodlight Controller, Open vSwitch, and Kamailio Server tools to evaluate the performance of ${ELQ}^{2}$. The findings suggest that the utilization of ${ELQ}^{2}$ holds promise in reducing the count of active servers and switches via effective resource management. Additionally, it demonstrates enhancements in various QoS and QoE parameters, encompassing throughput, multimedia delay, R Factor, and MOS, accomplished through load balancing strategies.

It particularly occurs under concurrent flow requests and so-called mice flows (MFs): elephant flows (EFs) ratio. Concentrating on a binary vision over flow size classification (EF or MF) results in subsequent unpredicted load imbalance due to neglecting EF's distinctions including a wide range of sizes. As a result, some EFs might utilize a path owing qualities beyond the given EF's demands, while another EF with higher requirements is attending to use an over-utilized path. This article proposes FMap, a fuzzy map for scheduling EFs through our proposed variant of traveling salesperson problem (TSP) toward DCNs. FMap represents a novel EF scheduling scheme that integrates flow prioritization and routing decisions under the event pf parallel incoming flows besides the cooperation of the controller and OpenFlow switches in software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. FMap adopts fuzzy inference process to overcome the vagueness over EF's resource allocation. Mainly, FMap proposes a new variant of TSP (optimized by genetic algorithm) which enables EF's group forwarding with a minimum cost. FMap reduces the total hop count of EFs through considering a single optimal path for delivering groups of EFs that contain a same tag (priority).

Free applications for multimedia transmission over the Internet have become increasingly popular, gaining considerable popularity around the world. This communication consists of two phases, i.e., signaling phase and media exchange phase. The SIP protocol is responsible for the MoIP network signaling to provide services such as VoIP, voice and video conferencing, video over demand (VoD), and instant messaging. This application layer protocol has been standardized by the IETF for initiating, managing, and tearing down multimedia sessions and has been widely used as the main signaling protocol on the Internet. The signaling and media are handled by SIP proxies and network switches, respectively. One of the most critical challenges in MoIP is the overloading of SIP proxies and network switches. Because of these challenges, a wide range of network users experiences a sharp drop in service quality. Overload occurs when there are not enough processing resources and memory to process all the messages due to the lack of proper routing. This study aims to model the routing problem in MoIP by providing a framework based on software-defined networking (SDN) technology and a convex mathematical programming model to prevent overload. The proposed framework is simulated and implemented using various scenarios and network topologies. The results show that throughput, latency, message retransmission rate, and resource consumption have improved using the proposed approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature",Multi-objective optimization; Networking and computing resource allocation; Overload control; SIP servers; Software-defined networking; Voice over IP (VoIP;,,,12,,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,19400158593,14,9/23/2025,1/27/2025 3:23,,0.41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ever-increasing multimedia applications and services led to an outburst in IoMT. The multimedia things connected to IoMT are also increasing; millions of devices and high volume of traffic. This large traffic is directed toward the servers of the service provider in the IoMT cloud through the network switches. As a result, the IoMT infrastructure is facing the crisis of the resource management of switches and servers from two aspects: 1) load imbalance and 2) energy loss. This article proves that the problem of optimal resource management of IoMT networks with the energy and load constraints simultaneously is an NP-hard problem that has a high time complexity. The problem has decomposed. Then, we propose a modular system of energy and load control in IoMT using the concepts of network softwarization and virtual resources. The proposed controller first dynamically adjusts the resources through accurate determination of the IoMT network size. It then distributes the load between the IoMT servers as well as routes the traffic between switches to the desired server. The Open vSwitch, Floodlight Controller, and Kaa Servers are, respectively, used for implementing the switches, controller, and servers of IoMT in the test platform. The results show that the proposed system both minimizes the number of IoMT active servers and switches and distributes the load between them. As a result, the parameters for evaluating the quality of service and quality of experience, such as throughput, multimedia delay, R factor, and mean opinion score improved. © 2021 IEEE",Cloud computing; Multimedia communication; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Resource management; Servers; Streaming media;,,,31,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,21100338350,9,2/1/2022,1/27/2025 3:24,,3.04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Communication in VoIP networks consists of two main phases, for example, signaling and media exchange. VoIP servers are responsible for signaling exchange using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the signaling protocol. The saturation of SIP server resources is one of the issues with the VoIP network, which causes problems such as overload or loss of energy. Resource saturation occurs mainly due to a lack of integrated server resource management. In the traditional VoIP networks, management and routing are distributed among all equipment, including servers. These servers are overloaded during peak times and face energy loss during idle times. Given the importance of this issue, this paper introduces a framework based on Software-Defined Networking technology for SIP server resource management. The advantage of this framework is to have a global view of all the server resources. In this framework, the resource allocation optimization problem and resource autoscaling are presented to deal with the problems posed. The goal is to maximize total throughput and minimize energy consumption. In this regard, we seek to strike a balance between efficiency and energy. The proposed framework is implemented in the actual testbed.

Since Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides fine granular control, it can be intelligently programmed to distinguish between flow requirements. The present article proposes a knapsack model in which the link bandwidth and incoming flows are modeled as a knapsack capacity and items, respectively. Furthermore, each flow consists of two size and value aspects, acquired through flow size extraction and the type of service value assigned by the SDN controller decision. Indeed, the current work splits the incoming flow size range into Type of Service (ToS) decimal value numbers. The lower the flow size category, the higher the value dedicated to the flow. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes the knapsack problem and first forwards the selected-flows by KP-PSO, and the non-selected-flows second. To address the shortcomings of these methods in the event of dense parallel flow detection, the present study puts the link under the threshold of a 70% load by simultaneous requests.

With a widely growing adoption rate, session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer signaling protocol, standardized by the IETF, for creating, modifying, and terminating VoIP sessions. Generally speaking, SIP routes a call request to its destination by using SIP proxies. With the increasing use of SIP, traditional configurations pose certain drawbacks, such as ineffective routing, un-optimized management of proxy resources (including CPU and memory), and overload conditions. This paper presents OpenSIP to upgrade the SIP network framework with emerging technologies, such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). SDN provides for management that decouples the data and control planes along with a software-based centralized control that results in effective routing and resource management. Moreover, NFV assists SDN by virtualizing various network devices and functions. However, current SDN elements limit the inspected fields to layer 2-4 headers, whereas SIP routing information resides in the layer-7 header. A benefit of OpenSIP is that it enforces policies on SIP networking that are agnostic to higher layers with the aid of a deep packet inspection engine. Among the benefits of OpenSIP is programmability, cost reduction, unified management, routing, as well as efficient load balancing. This paper implements OpenSIP on a real testbed which includes Open vSwitch and the Floodlight controller.

The session initiation protocol (SIP) with respect to facilities such as being in text form, end-to-end connection, independence from the type of transmitted data, and support various forms of transmission, is an appropriate choice for signalling protocol in order to make connection between two IP network users. These advantages have made SIP be considered as a signalling protocol in IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), a proposed signalling platform for NGNs. Despite having all these advantages, SIP protocol lacks appropriate mechanism for addressing overload causing serious problems for SIP servers. SIP overload occurs when a SIP server does not have enough resources to process messages. The fact is that the performance of SIP servers is largely degraded during overload periods because of the retransmission mechanism of SIP. In this paper, we propose an advanced mechanism, which is an improved method of the windows based overload control in RFC 6357. In the windows based overload control method, the window is used to limit the amount of message generated by SIP proxy server. A distributed adaptive window-based overload control algorithm, which does not use explicit feedback from the downstream server, is proposed. The number of confirmation messages is used as a measure of the downstream server load. Thus, the proposed algorithm does not impose any additional complexity or processing on the downstream server, which is overloaded, making it a robust approach. Our proposed algorithm is developed and implemented based on an open source proxy. The results of evaluation show that proposed method could maintain the throughput close to the theoretical throughput, practically and fairly.

In modern datacenters, user network traffic requires a set of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) as a service chain to process traffic demands.

In this paper, we propose a distributed approach based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to jointly load balance the traffic and horizontally scale up and down VNFs in LDCs with minimum deployment and forwarding costs. Initially we formulate the targeted optimization problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, which is NP-complete. Secondly, we relax it into two Linear Programming (LP) models to cope with over and underloaded service chains. In the case of small or medium size datacenters, LP models could be run in a central fashion with a low time complexity. However, in LDCs, increasing the number of LP variables results in additional time consumption in the central algorithm. To mitigate this, our study proposes a distributed approach based on ADMM.

An important one is that its throughput can be severely degraded when an overload happens in the proxy server because of several retransmissions from the user agent. One common approach to overcome this problem is ‘load balancing’. A balancer needs to know the status of proxy servers, which are continuously gathered implicitly or explicitly. Implicit methods have averagely less overhead than explicit ones. This paper attempts to prevent throughput reduction by balancing the loads among available proxy servers properly using an implicit mechanism called History Weighted Average Response time. The proposed algorithm is robust because it incurs no extra processing to proxy servers. The novelty of the mechanism is making use of ‘response time history’ to estimate the load being currently processed on servers. By implementing in a real testbed, throughput and scalability are improved compared with an important state-of-the-art similar algorithm. This improvement stems from no need for modification in SIP protocol, easy implementation and application, simple computations for making decision and no need for extra feedback between servers and load balancer.

This protocol has also been recognised by International Telecommunication Union as a main core of next-generation networks. When this network is under overload for reasons such as improper design, instantaneous swarm, components error and sudden reduction of processing capacity, its efficiency is considerably reduced. Overload occurs when the SIP proxy lacks sufficient CPU and memory resources to process all messages. Because the overload cannot be prevented completely, it is important to equip SIP proxies with an effective overload mitigation mechanism. In this paper, capabilities of transmission control protocol are used in transport layer to reduce SIP proxy overload through the proper allocation of proxy resources. Major activities in this field assume SIP on user datagram protocol, which practically does not result in optimal throughput. To evaluate this approach, an Asterisk open source proxy is used. Our implementation results in the real testbed indicate the efficiency improvement of Asterisk proxy under overload.

An open issue is the control of overload that occurs when a SIP server lacks sufficient CPU and memory resources to process all messages. We prove that the problem of overload control in SIP network with a set of n servers and limited resources is in the form of NP-hard. This paper proposes a Load-Balanced Call Admission Controller (LB-CAC), based on a heuristic mathematical model to determine an optimal resource allocation in such a way that maximizes call admission rates regarding the limited resources of the SIP servers. LB-CAC determines the optimal »call admission rates» and »signaling paths» for admitted calls along optimal allocation of CPU and memory resources of the SIP servers through a new linear programming model. This happens by acquiring some critical information of SIP servers. An assessment of the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2015 IEEE",Linear programming; Multi-objective optimization; Resource allocation; SIP overload;,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On account of features as being in text form, end-to-end connection, independence from the type of transmitted data, and supporting various forms of transmission, is an appropriate choice for signaling protocol in order to make connection between two IP network users. These advantages have made SIP be considered as a signaling protocol in IMS, a proposed signaling platform for next generation networks. Despite having all these advantages, SIP protocol is in lacking of appropriate mechanism for addressing overload. In this paper the window-based overload control mechanism which does not require explicit feedback is developed and implemented on Asterisk open source proxy and evaluated. The results of implementation show that this method could practically maintain throughput in case of overload. As we know this is the only overload control method which is implemented on a real platform without using explicit feedback. The results show that the under load server maintains its throughput at the maximum capacity. © 2013 IEEE",Asterisk Proxy; Overload control; SIP;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
